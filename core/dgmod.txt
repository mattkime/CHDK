Todo:
- Implement separate configuration file dgmod.cfg so dgmod settings won't
  accidentally collide with trunk settings in the future.
- Implement 'find IS lens center' properly, including warnings etc. Code is
  basically done but needs to be cleaned up and adjusted into here.
- All the other stuff in the top-secret document.
